# Machine-Learning-API-using-FastAPI-for-Titanic-Survival-Prediction
*Titanic* is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. on April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the *titanic* sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.  
In this project, Machine Learning algorithm is used on the Titanic dataset for predicting the survival of the passenger.

## Objectives
Building an app that Predicts which passenger survived the Titanic using FastAPI
